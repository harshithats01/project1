                The Earth’s surface contains a number of diverse natural environments. A natural environment can be
                defined as the flora, fauna, rocks, minerals, and atmosphere that make up a single ecological system,
                often spanning a large area. Natural environments often overlap and compete with both each other and
                with human-built environments, such as cities, manufacturing plants, and parks.

                Different types of natural environments include oceans, grasslands, tundra, rainforests, and deserts.
                Each environment has unique soils, climates, water systems, and weather phenomena that are capable of
                supporting the life forms located in that environment. Natural environments are constantly changing and
                can be greatly impacted by Earth’s physical and chemical changes. The diversity of natural environment
                types reflects the rich variety of flora and fauna species on Earth, and the different conditions
                necessary for them to thrive.
