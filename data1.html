                The Earth’s surface contains a number of diverse natural environments. A natural environment can be
                defined as the flora, fauna, rocks, minerals, and atmosphere that make up a single ecological system,
                often spanning a large area. Natural environments often overlap and compete with both each other and
                with human-built environments, such as cities, manufacturing plants, and parks.

                Different types of natural environments include oceans, grasslands, tundra, rainforests, and deserts.
                Each environment has unique soils, climates, water systems, and weather phenomena that are capable of
                supporting the life forms located in that environment. Natural environments are constantly changing and
                can be greatly impacted by Earth’s physical and chemical changes. The diversity of natural environment
                types reflects the rich variety of flora and fauna species on Earth, and the different conditions
                necessary for them to thrive.

                The term ecosystem, meaning a system of living organisms in an area that depends on the proximate
                non-living resources to survive and reproduce, is often used interchangeably with the term natural
                environment. While this is correct in some cases, it is important to note that a single natural
                environment can also contain multiple ecosystems. The oceans are a good example of this, as the flora
                and fauna that thrives in coastal regions requires very different living conditions than the organisms
                found in the deep ocean.

                Rain forest environments are one type of natural ecosystem. In total, rain forests produce 40 percent of
                the oxygen on Earth, despite only taking up 6 percent of the Earth’s surface. They are made up of four
                layers: emergent, upper canopy, understory, and forest floor. While these layers are all part of one
                environment, the flora and fauna differ from layer to layer.
            </div>
            <div class="col col-12 col-sm-4 col-md-4 col-lg-4 col-xl-4 col-xxl-4">
                Rain forests get their name from the fact that they are almost completely self watering. Each tree that
                reaches the canopy level is able to release about 200 gallons of water into the air per year. This
                creates a permanent cloud that hangs low over the canopy, helping the forest stay hydrated between
                periods of rainfall. This creates a fertile environment for plants, with two thirds of the total plant
                species on Earth growing in the rain forest. In recent years, rain forest environments have been
                threatened by deforestation, and scientists have warned that further logging in rain forests could have
                long term negative effects on the Earth’s climate.
